Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistent and missing values
Data Exploration: Check for anomalies or outliers in sales, ratings, and other metrics.
Data Visualization: Creating charts like bar graphs, pie charts, and line plots to visualize sales, customer demographics, and monthly trends.

# Technologies used

Python: The primary programming language for data analysis
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis
matplotlib: For creating static and interactive visualizations
Jupyter Notebook: For combining data analysis, visualization, and narrative in a single environment.
